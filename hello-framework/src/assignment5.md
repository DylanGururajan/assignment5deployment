## Question 1

Dataset: energy consumption by sector

This dataset comes from a website with lots of datasets relating to energy consumption
being things like sources of energy (renewable / nonrenewable) or energy usage and more

I may merge this chosen dataset with another dataset from this website to bettwe answer 
my question

## Question 2

I don't have a clear vision yet, but a good question I can think of now is how have means 
of energy production changed over time in California in each sector

## Question 3

Idea: have animation handle time. Arranged dots in a rectangular formation where color indicates type
of energy and size indicates how much energy is produced from this datapoint. Dots can be divided by 
energy type per sector, so we can compare these changes across them

In other words, each row of dots will belong to one sector, and each column will be the same color, and 
represent the same source of energy production.

## Question 4

The interaction comes in with change over time. The dots will grow and shrink with each year, and there
must be some kind of year indication on top of the visual. Maybe for even further interactivity, the user
can hover over a dot and see more specific details about the change, and background on that sector/energy method

## Question 5

Scroll down to the visualization titled: "Data Breaches by data sensitivity"
In my idea, the dots would change size rapidly with changing year, but this is similar.
